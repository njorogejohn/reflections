Versions would help trace the changes made within the project in the due course of time. This would increase code reusability. 

Allow for programmer's judgement on commits. However, poor judgement may result in versions that don't work. 

Multiple-tracking iis important especially in coding where files are inter-related and dependent.

Git log and diff can be used to check on the changes of code between two commits. The log gets you the commits then check for the difference between them.
